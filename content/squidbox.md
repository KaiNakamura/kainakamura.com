Squidbox is a low-cost Bluetooth MIDI controller. It provides an intuitive and interactive way to learn about scales and chords while having fun making music. It runs on an ESP32 and features a 2-axis joystick, a small OLED screen, a knob, and multiple buttons.

I worked on this project as part of my humanities capstone with Evan Carmody, Dennis Garvey, Karish Gupta, and Niko Tan.
