I made this robot as part of one of my robotics courses, RBE 2001 - Unified Robotics I. The goal of this project was to create robots that could replace the solar panels on a miniature house.

I used SolidWorks to design a four-bar linkage and gripper mechanism to pickup and move the solar panels around. I also needed to design a gear box strong enough for the DC motor to lift the solid aluminum plates.
