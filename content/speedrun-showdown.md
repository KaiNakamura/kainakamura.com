Speedrun Showdown is a Minecraft Speedrunning Plugin written in Java. I created the plugin for an event organized by [Do Good Points](https://www.dogoodpoints.com/) that featured world record holding Minecraft speed runners and top-rated content creators.

The event raised money for [Plant with Purpose](https://plantwithpurpose.org/), a non-profit organization whose mission is to fight against global poverty and environmental damage. The tournament raised over $10,000 which equates to over 10,000 trees planted.
