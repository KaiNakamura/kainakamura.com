This project is an implementation of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). The robot uses a LIDAR sensor to scan its environment and search out new areas of the map to explore.

The video above covers SLAM, how a LIDAR sensor works, frontier exploration, pathfinding, pure pursuit, obstacle avoidance, and Monte Carlo localization.

This project was part, for one of my robotics courses, RBE 3002 - Unified Robotics IV.
