I created this project with two of my friends, Owen Sullivan and Evan Carmody, for one of my robotics courses, RBE 3001 - Unified Robotics III.

Our primary goal was to create a pick-and-place robot using a robotic arm and a camera. Colored 3D-printed balls are randomly placed for the robot to detect and sort. This project required us to explore and implement forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, trajectory generation, and a robust computer vision system.
